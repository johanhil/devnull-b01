Problem one is that it says onClick where it should be onclick.

The second problem is that the code is broken.

Javascript, different to many other languages, does not create a new scope inside of the for loop. This means that the var i is not local to the for loop, but to the function addButtonsToNode. So when you click the div's, the i that is alerted is not the correct i, but the latest i (all div's alert 5).

The solution to this problem is to use a closure, and wrap the onclick binding in a function where  i is a parameter.
